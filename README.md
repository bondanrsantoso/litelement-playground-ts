# Hello World
This is a playground project to learn about the rather niche front-end library called Polymer Project, specifically `lit-html` and `lit-element`

## Why Polymer `lit-element` and `lit-html`
Why not? My friend, who practically had no programming basic whatsoever (no offense), needs help about this topic (her employer put her straight into project using these libraries) so I think I can help her. After spending a good day reading the docs and playing around with the JavaScript flavor I am intrigued to try to build a second playground to explore the libraries in TypeScript. It is quite a fascinating insight on how web development would be in the future using webComponents and I think this library would be a good alternative to more complicated library such as React or Angular. I mean, **YouTube** apparently uses this library according to Wappalyzer, so it's supposed to be good.

## Installation
Pretty straightforward, I would say. After you clone the repo to your machine just run `npm install` and the playground pretty much ready to go.

A recommended method to serve the playground so it could be accessed properly on the browser is to put the project at your web server (e.g. Apache, nginx) document directory (e.g. `htdocs/` or `/var/www/something`). Another alternative to run the playground is to serve it using `polymer serve` command (make sure `polymer-cli` package installed globally) or using alternative webserver
